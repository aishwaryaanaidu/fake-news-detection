# Fake News Detection

The aim of this project is to accept a string as the input and classify it as fake or real. The performance of Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree Classifier Machine Learning models were compared. The accuracy of the Logistic Regression model was the highest. A web application was then developed using React JS to input the string to the Logistic Regression model through an API built using Flask.
